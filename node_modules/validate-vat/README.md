A very lightweight, tiny lib (no external dependencies) allows you to verify the validity of a VAT number issued by any European Union Member State. This lib is basically calling web service provided by VIES (at http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/checkVatService.wsdl) for VAT number validation. 

## What is a VAT number?
A value added tax identification number or VAT identification number (VATIN) is an identifier used in many countries, including the countries of the European Union, for value added tax purposes.

## Get started
```bash
npm install validate-vat
```
In your code
```javascript
var validate = require('validate-vat');
validate(countryCode, vatNumber, callback)
```
#### Example
```javascript
var validate = require('validate-vat');
validate( 'xx',  'xxxxxxx',  function(err, validationInfo) {
    console.log(validationInfo);
});
```

##### Returns
when valid
```javascript
{
  countryCode: 'xx',
  vatNumber: 'xxxxxxxxx',
  requestDate: '2013-11-22+01:00',
  valid: true,
  name: 'company name',
  address: 'company address'
}
```
when invalid
```javascript
{
  countryCode: 'xx',
  vatNumber: 'xxxxxxxxxx',
  requestDate: '2013-11-22+01:00',
  valid: false,
  name: '---',
  address: '---'
}
```
possible error messages
```javascript
  'The provided CountryCode is invalid or the VAT number is empty'
  'The VIES VAT service is unavailable, please try again later'
  'The VAT database of the requested member country is unavailable, please try again later'
  'The request to VAT database of the requested member country has timed out, please try again later'
  'The service cannot process your request, please try again later'
  'Unknown error'
```
For more details usage, please check test

## Change Log

### 0.7.0

### 0.6.0 
- Use https VIEW endpoint

### 0.5.0 
- Use IPv4 explicitly https://github.com/viruschidai/validate-vat/pull/13

### 0.4.0
- Added a timeout option in https://github.com/viruschidai/validate-vat/pull/9
- Upgraded versions of dev dependencies to latest versions

### 0.3.1
Wrap field parse in a try catch block when it can not parse a soap message. The soap message will be attached to the error object for furthur investigation.

### 0.3.0 - 05/Dec/2013
Instead of
`var validate = require('validate-vat').validate`
, you should call
`var validate = require('validate-vat)'
This will break your code, so update all the usages if you want to use this version
